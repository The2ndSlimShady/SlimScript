# Slim Script

Slim script is an interpreted scripting language for embedding it into your
projects. The interpreter is written in C# so it can (at least to a certain level)
interact with .Net ecosystem.

## Notes

It's a bit slow because of 
the usage of reflection under the hood but still, its decent enough (i think?)

## Further Reading

See [the docs](docs/docs.md)

## TODOs

- [ ] Current `@module` directive is stupid. Gonna make them act like both header-guards and namespaces.

Yep. That's all.
